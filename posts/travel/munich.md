# A small account of my trip to Munich during a weekend with Allianz Arena being the highlight

I visited Munich, the capital of Bavaria and the home of Oktoberfest. While there, I also went to Allianz Arena (colloquially refereed to as just "Arena"), the home of Bayern München (and slightly less known Turn- und Sportverein München von 1860 - aka TSV 1860 München). I took the stadium tour in English. It was off-season (with Euros going on) and hence the grass was cut reducing the appeal. It's quite a serene setting outside the stadium as you can see from the below pictures.

I took the subway to the Arena station (U-Bahnstation as the Germans refer to subway stations) and took a walk to the stadium. The unmistakeable structure appears from pretty far away and it's quite the sight. The tour guide did mention that the stadium is built in a way that even the spectators seated far away can get a good sight of the games.

Despite the naming rights that can change, Bayern owns the stadium while 1860 München pay to use it. The difference in fortunes of the two clubs couldn't be bigger with Bayern players arriving to the stadium in Audis while 1860 aren't even in the Bundesliga at the moment. Below are some images from the players entrance to the stadium and the dressing room.

Other than the Arena, I also visited the Deutsches Museum. Below are some pictures from the rest of the trip.

# During the tour, some Englishman asked the question - "Do Mönchengladbach also play here?"

# The tour guide - "Ha ha ha ha ha ..."
