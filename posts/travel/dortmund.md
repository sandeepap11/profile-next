# This is an account of my trip along with my friend to Dortmund for a Bundesliga game. A football crazy city and an atmosphere matched by none thanks to the yellow wall. The pictures appear with no relation to the text around them. I had initially published this on my company blog. Moving here for a wider audience.

Let's get started with a couple of pictures of the maginificient yellow wall 🙌🏻 -

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
