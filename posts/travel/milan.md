# This is write up of my stadium tour of San Siro as a part of my trip to Italy.

While in Milan, following a visit to Sforza Castle and the Piazza del Duomo, me and my roommate (the others opted out of this) took the stadium tour in San Siro (officially, Stadio Giuseppe Meazza). It's the home of both A C Milan and Internazionale although the tour as well as the gift shop are common, and quite unbiased. The tours happen everyday except on matchdays and is also available in English.

San Siro looks pretty good from the outside. A few pictures follow.

This was my first stadium visit in Europe and the outfield was quite beautiful with lush green grass. The capacity is also quite high. It was quite the scene in the haydays of A C Milan during European nights, Inter probably not as much. Some pictures from the field below.

All in all, at the end of the Italy trip, a memorable visit to San Siro for me as an admirer of Inter.

# I did buy a Ronaldo (R9) Inter shirt from the gift shop, but it was of very low quality. May be you could stay away from that :)
