# My first tour in Europe was to Italy, a place with so much history, passion for football and of course some amazing food. In 5 days, we covered Venice, Rome, Vatican City, Florence (Firenze), Pisa and Milan. This hardly makes any justice to what the place has to offer but it was definitely a trip to remember. Although we landed at Milan, we'll begin with Venice - the city of canals.

# The tour guide - "Ha ha ha ha ha ..."
