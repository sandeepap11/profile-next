# My first tour in Europe was to Italy, a place with so much history, passion for football and of course some amazing food.

When in Rome do as the Romans do, they say. Well, we didn't. Instead, in 5 days we covered Venice, Rome, Vatican City, Florence, Pisa and Milan. This hardly makes any justice to what the place has to offer but it was definitely a trip to remember. Although we landed at Milan, we'll begin with Venice - the city of canals.

## Venice

We headed to Venice (Venezia) in a rented car soon after landing in Milan and spending the night. Water everywhere, bridges and gondolas; connected by boats and ferries, and a few ships. For me, this was definitely the highlight because the experience is simply unmatched. A few pictures below.
